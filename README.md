# Passive Reconnaissance and Threat Modeling Report

## üìÑ Project Description
This repository contains a cybersecurity report focused on passive reconnaissance and threat modeling for the website [GeeksforGeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). The project aims to identify publicly available information using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools and outline potential threats from a security perspective.

## üß† Report Summary
The report includes:
- WHOIS and SSL/TLS certificate analysis  
- Google Dorking results to uncover indexed files  
- Technology stack detection via Wappalyzer  
- Threat modeling with identified actors, assets, and attack vectors  
- Detailed bug and vulnerability analysis with mitigation strategies  

## üìÇ Accessing the Report
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the file `Passive_Recon_Report.pdf` or `Passive_Recon_Report.md` to read the full report.
